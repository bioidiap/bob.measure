def recognition_rate(cmc_scores, threshold = None, rank = 1):
  """Calculates the recognition rate from the given input

  It is identical to the CMC value for the given ``rank``.

  The input has a specific format, which is a list of two-element tuples.  Each
  of the tuples contains the negative :math:`\\{S_p^-\\}` and the positive
  :math:`\\{S_p^+\\}` scores for one probe item :math:`p`, or ``None`` in case
  of open set recognition.  To read the lists from score files in 4 or 5 column
  format, please use the :py:func:`bob.measure.load.cmc_four_column` or
  :py:func:`bob.measure.load.cmc_five_column` function.

  If ``threshold`` is set to ``None``, the rank 1 recognition rate is defined
  as the number of test items, for which the highest positive
  :math:`\\max\\{S_p^+\\}` score is greater than or equal to all negative
  scores, divided by the number of all probe items :math:`P`:

  .. math::

    \\mathrm{RR} = \\frac{1}{P} \\sum_{p=1}^{P} \\begin{cases} 1 & \\mathrm{if } \\max\\{S_p^+\\} >= \\max\\{S_p^-\\}\\\\ 0 & \\mathrm{otherwise} \\end{cases}

  For a given rank :math:`r>1`, up to :math:`r` negative scores that are higher
  than the highest positive score are allowed to still count as correctly
  classified in the top :math:`r` rank.

  If ``threshold`` :math:`\\theta` is given, **all** scores below threshold
  will be filtered out.  Hence, if all positive scores are below threshold
  :math:`\\max\\{S_p^+\\} < \\theta`, the probe will be misclassified **at any
  rank**.

  For open set recognition, i.e., when there exist a tuple including negative
  scores without corresponding positive scores (``None``), and **all** negative
  scores are below ``threshold`` :math:`\\max\\{S_p^+\\} < \\theta`, the probe
  item is correctly rejected, **and it does not count into the denominator**
  :math:`P`.  When no ``threshold`` is provided, the open set probes will
  **always** count as misclassified, regardless of the ``rank``.

  .. warn:
     For open set tests, this rate does not correspond to a standard rate.
     Please use :py:func:`detection_identification_rate` and
     :py:func:`false_alarm_rate` instead.


  Parameters:

    cmc_scores (:py:class:`list`): A list in the format ``[(negatives,
      positives), ...]`` containing the CMC scores loaded with one of the
      functions (:py:func:`bob.measure.load.cmc_four_column` or
      :py:func:`bob.measure.load.cmc_five_column`).

      Each pair contains the ``negative`` and the ``positive`` scores for **one
      probe item**.  Each pair can contain up to one empty array (or ``None``),
      i.e., in case of open set recognition.

    threshold (:obj:`float`, optional): Decision threshold. If not ``None``, **all**
      scores will be filtered by the threshold. In an open set recognition
      problem, all open set scores (negatives with no corresponding positive)
      for which all scores are below threshold, will be counted as correctly
      rejected and **removed** from the probe list (i.e., the denominator).

    rank (:obj:`int`, optional):
      The rank for which the recognition rate should be computed, 1 by default.
