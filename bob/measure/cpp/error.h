   * Calculates the FA ratio and the FR ratio given positive and negative
   * scores and a threshold. 'positives' holds the score information for
   * samples that are labeled to belong to a certain class (a.k.a., "signal"
   * or "client"). 'negatives' holds the score information for samples that are
   * labeled *not* to belong to the class (a.k.a., "noise" or "impostor").
   *
   * It is expected that 'positive' scores are, at least by design, greater
   * than 'negative' scores. So, every positive value that falls bellow the
   * threshold is considered a false-rejection (FR). 'negative' samples that
   * fall above the threshold are considered a false-accept (FA).
   *
   * Positives that fall on the threshold (exactly) are considered correctly
   * classified. Negatives that fall on the threshold (exactly) are considered
   * *incorrectly* classified. This equivalent to setting the comparison like
   * this pseudo-code:
   *
   * foreach (positive as K) if K < threshold: falseRejectionCount += 1
   * foreach (negative as K) if K >= threshold: falseAcceptCount += 1
   *
   * The 'threshold' value does not necessarily have to fall in the range
   * covered by the input scores (negatives and positives altogether), but if
   * it does not, the output will be either (1.0, 0.0) or (0.0, 1.0)
   * depending on the side the threshold falls.
   *
   * The output is in form of a std::pair of two double-precision real numbers.
   * The numbers range from 0 to 1. The first element of the pair is the
   * false-accept ratio. The second element of the pair is the false-rejection
   * ratio.
   *
   * It is possible that scores are inverted in the negative/positive sense. In
   * some setups the designer may have setup the system so 'positive' samples
   * have a smaller score than the 'negative' ones. In this case, make sure you
   * normalize the scores so positive samples have greater scores before
   * feeding them into this method.

   * The predicate method gives back the current minimum given false-acceptance

   *
   * double predicate(double fa_ratio, double fr_ratio);

   * Please note that this method will only work with single-minimum smooth
   * predicates.
   *
   * The minimization is carried out in a data-driven way.
   * Starting from the lowest score (might be a positive or a negative), it
   * increases the threshold based on the distance between the current score
   * and the following higher score (also keeping track of duplicate scores)
   * and computes the predicate for each possible threshold.
